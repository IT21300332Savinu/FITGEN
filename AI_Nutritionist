AI Nutritionist & Meal Planner

This is a research-based Python project that functions as an AI-powered nutritionist and meal planning system. It uses machine learning models and NLP-based embeddings to predict personalized calorie needs and recommend meals for users based on their health conditions and dietary preferences.

Designed to be integrated with mobile health and fitness platforms (e.g., Flutter + Firebase), this project supports data-driven decision-making in meal planning, especially for individuals with chronic diseases.

Problem Statement

Modern diet and fitness apps often fail to consider **individual health conditions**, making meal suggestions that are unsuitable for people with diseases like diabetes, hypertension, or kidney problems.

This system fills that gap by:
- Predicting daily calorie intake using bio-data.
- Recommending disease-aware, contextually relevant meals.
- Enabling clinical diet planning with AI models trained on real nutrition data.

Key Features

- AI-Based Calorie Prediction 
  Uses a regression model to calculate the user's daily caloric need based on weight, height, age, gender, and physical activity.

- Personalized Meal Suggestions  
  Trained ML and NLP models generate meals tailored to user needs, using health conditions as input factors.

- NLP-Based Meal Embeddings  
  Sentence Transformers are used to vectorize meal descriptions and suggest contextually relevant options.

- Expandable for Clinical Use
  Data and models are structured for integration with telemedicine, hospital systems, and fitness apps.
